  abstract = {For count data, robust estimation of the number of mixture components in finite mixtures is revisited using L2 distance. An information criterion based on L2 distance is shown to yield an estimator, which is also shown to be strongly consistent. Monte Carlo simulations show that our estimator is competitive with other procedures in correctly determining the number of components when the data comes from Poisson mixtures. When the data comes from a negative binomial mixture but the postulated model is a Poisson mixture, simulations show that our estimator is highly competitive with the minimum Hellinger distance (MHD) estimator in terms of robustness against model misspecification. Furthermore, we illustrate the performance of our estimator for a real dataset with overdispersion and zero-inflation. Computational simplicity combined with robustness property makes the L2E approach an attractive alternative to other procedures in the literature.},

  abstract = {For finite mixtures, consistent estimation of unknown number of components, called mixture complexity, is considered based on a random sample of counts, when the exact form of component probability mass functions are unknown but are postulated to belong to some parametric family. Following a recent approach of Woo and Sriram [2006. Robust estimation of mixture complexity. J. Amer. Statist. Assoc., to appear.], we develop an estimator of mixture complexity as a by-product of minimizing a Hellinger information criterion, when all the parameters associated with the mixture model are unknown. The estimator is shown to be consistent. Monte Carlo simulations illustrate the ability of our estimator to correctly determine the mixture complexity when the postulated Poisson mixture model is correct. When the postulated model is a Poisson mixture but the data comes from a negative binomial mixture with moderate to more extreme overdispersion in one of its components, simulation results show that our estimator continues to perform well. These confirm the efficiency of the estimator when the model is correctly specified and the robustness when the model is incorrectly specified. A count dataset with overdispersion and possible zero inflation is analyzed to further illustrate the ability of our estimator to determine the number of components.},

Minimum Hellinger distance estimates are asymptotically efficient if the data come from a member of the parametric family and are robust to certain departures from the parametric family. A new algorithm is introduced that is similar to the EM algorithm, and a specialized adaptive density estimate is also introduced. Standard measures of robustness are discussed, and some difficulties are noted. The robustness and asymptotic efficiency of the estimators are illustrated using simulations.},

A tentative physical model, derived from Rinehart, is outlined and a corresponding first-order Markov chain examined. It is shown that a second-order model is necessary to explain the observed correlations in the data. A curious clustering effect is apparent in the autocorrelation function when plotted over a large range of lags. Similar patterns are observed in simulations from the fitted second-order model.},
